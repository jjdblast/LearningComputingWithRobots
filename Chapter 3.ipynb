      "If you think of your robot as a creature that acts in the world, then by programming it, you are essentially building the creature's brain. The power of computers lies in the fact that the same computer or the robot can be supplied a different program or brain to make it behave like a different creature. For example, a program like Firefox or Explorer makes your computer behave like a web browser. But switching to your Media Player, the computer behaves as a DVD or a CD player. Similarly, your robot will behave differently depending upon the instructions in the program that you have requested to run on it. In this chapter we will learn about the structure of Python programs and how you can organize different robot behaviors as programs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The world of robots and computers, as you have seen so far, is intricately connected. You have been using a computer to connect to your robot and then controlling it by giving it commands. Most of the commands you have used so far come from the Myro library which is specially written for easily controlling robots. The programming language we are using to do the robot programming is Python. Python is a general purpose programming language. By that we mean that one can use Python to write software to control the computer or another device like a robot through that computer. Thus, by learning to write robot programs you are also learning how to program computers. Our journey into the world of robots is therefore intricately tied up with the world of computers and computing. We will continue to interweave concepts related to robots and computers throughout this journey. In this chapter, we will learn more about robot and computer programs and their structure. "

Thus, by parameterizing the function with those two values, you are able to produce similar but varying outcomes. This idea is similar to the idea of mathematical functions: $\\sin(x)$ for example, computes the sine of whatever value you supply for $x$. However, there has to be a way of defining the function in the first place that makes it independent of specific parameter values. That is where names come in. In the definition of the function `yoyo` you have named two parameters (the order you list them is important): speed and waitTime. Then you have used those names to specify the behavior that makes up that function. That is the commands `forward`, and `backward` use the names `speed` and `waitTime` to specify whatever the speed and wait times are included in the function invocation. Thus, the names `speed` and `waitTime` represent or designate specific values in this Python program.\n",

For example, it would make sense if you named a function `turnRight` so that when invoked, the robot turned right. It would not make any sense if the robot actually turned left instead, or worse yet, did the equivalent of the yoyo dance. But maintaining this kind of semantic consistency is entirely up to you."

      "One thing you could do is simply modify those two lines to reflect the different values. However, typical programs are much more complicated than this one and it may require a number of different values for solving a problem. When programs get larger, it is not a good idea to modify them for every specific problem instance but it is desirable to make them more useful for all problem instances. One way you can achieve this is by using the `input` facilities of Python. All computer programs typically take some input, do some computation (or something), and then produce some output. Python has a simple input command that can be used to rewrite the program above as follows: "

If the room does not have any obstacles in it (i.e. an empty room), the robot may plan to vacuum the room by starting from one corner and then going along the entire length of the long wall, then turning around slightly away from the wall, and traveling to the other end. In this manner, it will ultimately reach the other side of the room in a systematic way and then it could stop when it reaches the last corner. This is similar to the way one would mow a flat oblong lawn, or even harvest a field of crop, or re-ice an ice hockey rink using a Zamboni machine. To answer the question posed above all you have to do is calculate the total distance travelled and the average speed of the vacuum robot and use the two to compute the estimated time it would take. However, what if the room has furniture and other objects in it? \n",

You might be tempted to redesign the vacuuming strategy to allow for random movements and then estimate (based on average speed of the robot) that after some generous amount of time, you can be assured that the room would be completely cleaned. It is well known (and we will see this more formally in a later chapter) that random movements over a long period of time do end up providing uniform and almost complete coverage. Inherently this also implies that the same spot may very well end up being vacuumed several times (which is not necessarily a bad thing!). This is similar to the thinking that a herd of sheep, if left grazing on a hill, will result, after a period of time, in a nearly uniform grass height (think of the beautiful hills in Wales). \n"

Thus, the total behavior of a robot is directly dependent upon the time it would take to execute all the commands that make up the behavior. Knowing how long a behavior will take can help in pre-programming the total amount of time the overall behavior could last. For example, if you wanted the robot to perform the dance moves for 60 seconds, you can repeat the `dance` behavior ten times. You can do this by simply issuing the `dance` command 10 times. But that gets tedious for us to have to repeat the same commands so many times. Computers are designed to do repetitious tasks.

      "This chapter introduced the basic structure of Python (and robot) programs. We also learned about *names* and *values* in Python. Names can be used to designate functions and values. The latter are also called *variables*. Python provides several different types of values: integers, floating point numbers, strings, and also boolean values (`True` and `False`). Most values have built-in operations (like addition, subtration, etc.) that perform calculations on them. Also, one can form sequences of values using lists. Python provides simple built-in facilities for obtaining input from the user. All of these enable us to write not only robot programs but also programs that perform any kind of computation. Repetition is a central and perhaps the most useful concept in computing. In Python you can specify repetition using either a `for`-loop or a `while`-loop. The latter are useful in writing general robot brain programs. In later chapters, we will learn how to write more sophisticated robot behaviors. "

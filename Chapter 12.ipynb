      "Nearly two decades ago, Brooks and Flynn laid out a radical vision for the future that, on July 4, 1997, resulted in successful landing of Sojourner rover on the surface of Mars. A few years later, in 2004, two rovers Spirit and Opportunity arrived on Mars to explore the planet. In 2002, in his book, Flesh and Machines, a more reflective Rodney Brooks confesses to his exuberance in making the comments in his paper with Anita Flynn and describes the rovers as planetary ambassadors. The vision put forward by Brooks and Flynn was to replace a single large 1000 kilogram rover by 100 smaller 1 kilogram rovers to explore planetary surfaces. The smaller robots would move much faster and could be built much cheaper and mass produced. They will also offer much needed redundancy in case of occasional robot failure which in the case of a single larger robot would lead to total mission failure. Moreover, each individual robot would be autonomous (i.e. out of human control) operating on its own agenda as defined in its control program. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is debatable whether Brooks actually coined the phrase, *fast, cheap and out of control*. But the credit for using it in the title of their landmark paper followed by the deployment of three rovers on Mars led to its widespread use in popular culture. The phrase became the title of a 1997 documentary movie by Errol Morris in which Brooks himself was featured. In his 2002 book, Brooks recounts how a scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory lambasted the idea of fast, cheap, and autonomous rovers. While the original dream of 100 small, autonomous robots remains to be realized, today one would find it hard to argue against the idea. We have used Brooks\u2019 phrase in the title of this chapter to suggest that less than twenty years from the coining of the phrase we are in the thick of exploring the full potential of small, cheap, personal robots. Given that several million personal robots have already been sold, we could conclude that our planet itself has been invaded by them. Brooks says that, \"the robotics revolution is in its nascent stage, set to burst over us in the early part of the twenty-first century.\" In this chapter we present several examples of the ways robots are becoming a part of our everyday lives.\n"

In the course of this journey we have learned valuable lessons in building different kinds of robot brains, how to design insect-like behaviors, create sounds, images, and also ventured briefly into the realm of Artificial Intelligence. Computing lies at the heart of defining automated control. Any robot, no matter how small or large, has sensing and motor mechanisms and its behavior can be programmed to enable it to act autonomously in its environment. It is important to keep this in mind as we explore the various dimensions of the robotics spectrum. \n",

A GPS enables you to enter a destination or a point of interest and then it plots a route for you to take. It provides real-time map-based turn-by-turn guidance. The technology used in these devices uses mechanisms that involve satellite signals and street maps. These devices also form the core of autopilot mechanisms in an airplane. An airplane operating in autopilot mode can be considered a robot by our definition. Over 90% take-offs and landings of commercial flights these days are done using autopilot systems. You may have also read about robotic surveillance drones that are used by the army to spy on enemy territories. Unmanned guided missiles use similar devices. The technology also exists today to create autopilot systems in cars. That is, it is possible for your car to drive itself to wherever you\u2019d like it to go.

      "In Chapter 10 we mentioned that one of the challenges of AI research is to understand and/or artificially create human-level embodied intelligence. Many AI researchers work on advancing the state of understanding human intelligence while many others are working on building smarter, more intelligent models of behaviors. At the same time the field of robotics itself is rapidly moving in the direction of more capable, agile, and human-like robots. A good, fun way to find convergence of these advances can be seen in the goals of the RoboCup (www.robotcup.org). The RoboCup organization is focusing on soccer playing robots as a test bed for AI and robotics. They hold yearly robot soccer playing competitions that include, besides two-legged humanoids, four-legged and wheeled robot soccer players. \n",

Given that we already have millions of robots amongst us, it is important to recognize the need for creating friendlier ways of interacting with robots. While we are of the opinion that every citizen of this planet should be well versed in programming and computation we also recognize that we are nowhere near that goal. As we mentioned several times earlier soon there will be more computers than people on this planet. Perhaps robots will also follow? Nevertheless the need for friendlier interactions with computers has always been recognized. With the rapid increase in the number of robot-based applications it would be even more imperative for robots, especially given their physical presence, to have socially relevant behavior traits. If not for any other reason, it would make it easier for people to accept them into our society and many levels.\n"

Emotive robots have been studied in many applications that range from toys to medical therapy (we mentioned the Paro seal robot in Chapter 1). Given the interest and recent advances in the area of HRI a new field of research has emerged: social robotics. Social robotics studies models that take into account social norms of behavior relevant to the environment and/or application of the robot. Emotions can play an important role in this area of research. Within the relatively small community of researchers there is much debate about whether social robotics requires one to have a physical robot. Simulated agents acting socially are acceptable to some researchers but not to others. Take for example the simulated robotic agent Ananova (www.ananova.com). Ananova was designed to deliver news over the web just as a news anchor might on TV. While it is not a physically embodied robot, it has the simulated morphology of a human and is capable of using the same models of emotion and expression that are designed for embodied robots. In fact, given the physical limitations of robots, the simulation is far more realistic (see picture on right)."

      "The picture above is among one of thousands sent back by Spirit and Opportunity from the surface of Mars. It goes without saying that it will probably be several years, decades or even more, before a human ever sets foot on Mars. The rovers Spirit and Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004 as robot geologists whose mission was to analyze rocks and soils of the red planet in search for clues to past presence of water on the planet. The two robots were expected to last about 90 days. Years later, they were still exploring the planet's surface and sending invaluable geological and pictorial data from the planet. Only in the spring of 2011 did NASA suspend operations on Spirit but its twin, Opportunity, is still continuing to explore the planet while NASA is getting ready to send another rover, Curiosity, to explore Mars.\n",

      "Back on Earth, the same month as the rovers landing on Mars, the Tumbleweed robot rover traveled 40 miles across Antarctica\u2019s polar plateau transmitting local meteorological data back to its base station via satellite. Besides surviving adverse conditions on Mars and Antarctica, robots are slowly becoming household consumer items. Take for instance, the Roomba from iRobot Corporation. Introduced in 2002, more than 6 million Roombas have been sold to vacuum and clean floors. \n",
      "\n",
      "One commonality among the robots mentioned above is that they are all designed for very specific tasks: analyze rocks and soils on the surface of Mars, meteorology on the polar cap, or vacuuming a room. Yet, the core of robot technology is almost as easy to use as computers. In this course you will be given a personal robot of your own. Through this personal robot, you will learn to give it instructions to do a variety of tasks. Like the robots mentioned above your robot is also a rover. However, unlike the robots above, your personal robot does not come pre-programmed to do any specific task. It has certain basic capabilities (that you will learn about) and it can be programmed to make use of its capabilities to do various tasks. We hope that the process of learning about the capabilities of your robot and making it do different things will be exciting and fun for you. In this chapter, we introduce you to the world of robots and then introduce you to your own personal robot and some of its capabilities. \n"

      "The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary gives the following definitions of the word robot: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. a machine that looks like a human being and performs various complex acts (as walking or talking) of a human being; also a \n",
      "similar but fictional machine whose lack of capacity for human emotions is often emphasized; and also an efficient insensitive person who functions automatically \n",
      "2. a device that automatically performs complicated often repetitive tasks \n",
      "3. a mechanism guided by automatic controls \n",
      "\n",
      "In today's world, the first two definitions will probably be considered archaic (the third interpretation in the first definition notwithstanding). Robots were originally conceived as human-like entities, real or fictional, devoid of emotions, that performed tasks that were repetitive or full or drudgery. Today's robots come in all kinds of shapes and sizes and take on all kinds of tasks (see below for some examples). While many robots are put to use for repetitive or dull tasks (including the Roomba; unless you enjoy the therapeutic side effects of vacuuming :-), robots today are capable of doing a lot more than implied by the first two definitions above. Even in fictional robots the lack of emotional capacity seems to have been overcome (see for instance Steven Spielberg\u2019s movie, Artificial Intelligence). \n",
      "For our purposes, the third definition is more abstract and perhaps more appropriate. A robot is a mechanism or an artificial entity that can be guided by automatic controls. The last part of the definition, guided by automatic controls, is what we will focus on in this course. That is, given a mechanism capable of such guidance, what is involved in creating its controls?\n",

      "Modern robots were initially conceived as industrial robots designed to assist in automated manufacturing tasks. The first commercial robot company, Unimation, was created nearly 50 years ago. As the use of robots in industrial manufacturing grew, people also started experimenting with other uses of robots. Earlier industrial robots were mainly large arms that were attached to a fixed base. However, with the development of mobile robots people started to find uses for them in other domains. For instance, in exploring hazardous environments ranging from radioactive sites, volcanoes, finding and destroying mines, military surveillance, etc. We started this chapter by introducing you to two Mars rover robots. The first ever planetary rover landed on Mars in 1997. Increasingly in the last decade or so robots have ventured into newer and more exciting areas like medicine (Google: robotic surgery, robot wheelchair, etc.), toys and entertainment (Google: Pleo, SONY Aibo, LEGO Mindstorms, etc.), and even education (Google: IPRE). Some of the most exciting developments in robotics are still in research stages where, for example, in Artificial Intelligence research people are trying to develop intelligent robots and also using robots to understand and explore models of human intelligence. Here we have provided some pointers (do the searches mentioned above) for examples of various robots and their uses. There are numerous web sites where you can look up more about the history of robots. We will leave that as an exercise."

      "In the last few decades computers have become increasingly ubiquitous. Most likely you are reading this sentence on a computer. If you\u2019re reading this text online, the text itself is coming to you from another computer (located somewhere on the western banks of the Delaware River in south-eastern parts of the state of Pennsylvania in the United Stated of America). On its journey from the computer in Pennsylvania to your computer, the text has probably traveled through several computers (several dozen if you are outside the state of Pennsylvania!). What makes this journey of this text almost instantaneous is the presence of communication networks over which the internet and the World Wide Web operate. Advances in the technologies of wireless communication networks make it possible to access the internet from nearly any place on the planet. The reason that you are sitting in front of a computer and learning about robots is primarily because of the advent of these technologies. While robots are not quite as ubiquitous as computers, they are not too far behind. In fact, it is precisely the advances in computers and communications technologies that have made it feasible for you to become more familiar with the world of robots.\n",

Automatically controlling a robot almost always implies that there is a computer involved. So, in the process of learning about and playing with robots you will also uncover the world of computers. Your robot has a computer embedded in it. You will be controlling the robot through your computer. Moreover, you will do this over a wireless communication technology called bluetooth. Initially, for our purposes, learning to automatically control a robot is going to be synonymous with learning to control a computer. This will become more obvious as we proceed through these lessons.\n",

Once configured, you will be able to control the robot's movements (and all other features) through the computer. Besides moving, your robot can also play sounds (beeps) and, with the help of a pen inserted in its pen port, it can draw a line wherever it goes (hence its name, Scribbler). The robot can move forward, backward, turn, spin, or perform any combination of these movements giving it adequate functionality to travel anywhere on the surface of an environment. Besides roving, the Scribbler robot can also sense certain features of its environment. For example, it is capable of sensing a wall or an obstacle, or a line on the floor.

Bluetooth technology is a common wireless communication technology that enables electronic devices to talk to each other over short distances. For example, Bluetooth is most commonly used in cell phones to enable wireless communication between a cell phone (which may be in your pocket) and your wireless headset. This kind of communication requires two physical devices that serve as receivers and transmitters. In the Scribbler kit you received, there is a pair of these Bluetooth devices: one connects into the scribbler (Fluke Dongle) and the other into the USB port of your computer. If your computer has a built-in Bluetooth capability, you may not need the one that goes into your computer. Go ahead and make sure that these devices are plugged in, the robot is turned on, and so is your computer. Open up the Bluetooth configuration facility on your computer to get the port number being used for communication. On Windows this will be something like COM12 (the actual number will vary).

      "Congratulations! You have now completed the first Exercise and you are well on your way to more fun and exciting things with your robot. Before we move on, it would be a good idea to review what you just did. Each session with a robot begins by starting the Python software (Step 1 above), followed by importing the Myro library and initializing the robot. From then on, you can issue any command to the robot. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Myro library contains dozens of commands that enable various kinds of robot behaviors. In the next few weeks we will be learning several robot commands and learning how to use them to program complex robot behaviors. One thing to remember at this juncture is that all commands are being issued in the Python language. Thus, as you learn more about your robot and its behaviors, you will also be learning the Python language. \n",
      "\n",
      "One characteristic of programming languages (like Python) is that they have a very strict way of typing commands. That is, and you may already have experienced this above, the language is very precise about what you type and how you type it. Every parenthesis, quotation mark, and upper and lower case letter that makes up a command has to be typed exactly as described. While the rules are strict, luckily there aren't too many of them. Soon you will get comfortable with this syntax and it will become second nature. The precision in syntax is required so that the computer can determine exactly one interpretation for the command resulting in desired action. For this reason, computer languages are often distinguished from human languages by describing them as formal languages (as opposed to natural languages that are used by humans).\n"

Pressing each of the numbered buttons will result in different behaviors, some will make the robot beep, some will make the computer speak or say things.

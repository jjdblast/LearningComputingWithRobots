      "Writing programs is all about exercising control. In the case of a robot\u2019s brain your program directs the operations of a robot. However, it is also important to realize that the program itself is really controlling the computer. That is, when you write Python programs you are controlling the computer that is then communicating with the robot. Your program is directing the computer to control the robot. If you take Myro out of the picture you are writing programs to control the computer. This is the sense in which learning with robots also leads to learning computing. Every program you write is doing computation. Contrary to popular misconceptions computing is not just about doing calculations with numbers. Controlling your robot is also computing, as is predicting the world\u2019s population, or composing an image, etc. This is one aspect of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "When writing robot control programs, the structure you use to organize the program itself is a control strategy. Programming a robot is specifying automated control. As a programmer or behavior designer you structure your program to accomplish the goals of the behavior: how the sensors are used to decide what to do next. This is another aspect of control. So far, you have seen how to write control programs using Braitenberg style sensor-motor wiring. You have also seen how to specify reactive control. These are examples of two robot control paradigms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter we delve further into the world of computation and robot control paradigms. We will learn how to write robot control programs for more complex and more robust robot tasks. We will also see how, using the concepts learned so far, we can write useful and interesting computer applications.\n",

      "        # do forever or for some time\n",

      "           # do it\n",
      "       \n",
      "As you have seen, such a control program works well for many simple tasks. However, you may have already run into many situations where, once the task gets a little complex, it becomes difficult to structure a program in terms of a single stream of control as shown above. For example, the corral exiting behavior from the last chapter requires you to combine two simple behaviors: solve a maze (avoid obstacles) and seek light to get out of the corral. As you have seen before, it is fairly easy to program each of the individual behaviors: obstacle avoidance; light following. But, when you combine these behaviors to accomplish the corral exiting behavior two things happen: you are forced to amalgamate the two control strategies into a single one and it may become difficult to decide which way to combine them; additionally, the resulting program is not very pretty and hard to read. In reality, hardly any robot programs are written that way. In this section, we will look at a different way of structuring robot programs that makes designing behaviors easy, and yet, the resulting structure of the overall program is also clean and straightforward. You can design some very sophisticated behaviors using these ideas. \n",
      "\n",
      "People in the robotics community call the style of programming shown above as *reactive control* or *direct control*. Also referred to as *sensor fusion*, the resulting programs are purely sensor driven and hence appear to be too bottom-up. That is, the values of the sensors drive the logic of control as opposed to the goals of the robot tasks themselves. In *behavior-based control* you get away from sensors and focus the design of your robot programs based on the number and kinds of behaviors your robot has to carry out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let us look at how behavior-based control enables us to design the corral exiting behavior. The robot essentially has to carry out three kinds of behaviors: cruise (in the absence of any obstacles and/or light), avoid obstacles (if present), and seek light (if present). In a behavior-based style of writing programs, you will define each of these behaviors as an individual decision unit. Thus, each is quite simple and straightforward to write. Next, the control program has to fuse the behaviors recommended by each individual behavior unit. Look at the picture shown below: \n",
      "\n",
      "![](chap7i2full.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the diagram above, we have shown the three basic behaviors that we are trying to combine: `Cruise`, `Avoid`, `SeekLight`. Each of these behaviors outputs a triple: Yes/No, Translate Speed, Rotate Speed. A Yes implies that the behavior module has a recommendation. No implies that it doesn't. That is, it allows the possibility of a behavior having no recommendation. For example, in the corral exiting situation, in the absence of a light source being sensed by the robot, the `SeekLight` module will not have any recommendation. It then becomes the task of the arbitrator (or the decision module) to decide which of the available recommendations to use to drive the robot. Notice that in the end to control the robot, all one has to do is decide how much to translate and rotate. Many different arbitration schemes can be incorporated. We will use a simple but effective one: Assign a priority to each behavior module. Then the arbitrator always chooses the highest priority recommendation. This style of control architecture is also called *subsumption architecture*. In the figure above, we have actually drawn the modules in the order of their priority: the higher the module is in the figure, the higher its priority. The lowest behavior, cruise does not require any sensors and is always present: it wants the robot to always go forward. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arranging a control based on combining simple behaviors has several advantages: you can design each individual behavior very easily; you can also test each individual behavior by only adding that behavior and seeing how well it performs; you can incrementally add any number of behaviors on top of each other. In the scheme above, the control regime implies that the robot will always cruise forward. But, if there is an obstacle present, it will override the cruise behavior and hence try to avoid the obstacle. However, if there is a light source detected, it will supersede all behaviors and engage in light seeking behavior. Ideally, you can imagine that all the behaviors will be running simultaneously (asynchronously). In that situation, the arbitrator will always have one or more recommendations to adopt based on priority. \n",

      "Your current car, an adorable 1992 SAAB 93 was bought used and, for past several months, you have had nothing but trouble keeping the car on the road. Last night the ignition key broke off in the key slot when you were trying to start it and now the broken piece would not come out (this used to happen a lot with older SAAB's). The mechanic has to dismantle the entire ignition assembly to get the broken key out and it could cost you upwards of $\\$500$. The car's engine, which has done over $185,000$ miles, has left you stranded on the road many times. You have decided that this is it; you are going to go out and get yourself a brand new reliable car. You have been moonlighting at a restaurant to make extra money and have managed to save $\\$5500.00$ for exactly this situation. You are now wondering what kind of new car you can buy. Obviously, you will have to take a loan from a bank to finance the rest of the cost but you are not sure how big a loan, and therefore what kind of car, you can afford. You can write a small Python program to help you try out various scenarios. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can either dream (realistically) of the car you would like to buy, or you can go to any of the helpful car buying sites on the web (http://www.edmunds.com) is a good place to start). Let us say that you have spent hours looking at features and options and have finally narrowed your desires to a couple of choices. Your first choice is going to cost you $\\$22,000.00$ and your second choice is priced at $\\$18,995.00$. Now you have to decide which of these you can actually afford to purchase. \n",

Given all this information, you are now ready to write a program that can help you figure out which of the two choices you may be able to make. In order to secure the loan, you have to ensure that you have enough money to pay the local sales tax (a $6\\%$ sales tax on a $\\$20,000$ car will add up to a hefty $\\$1200$!). After paying the sales tax you can use the remainder of the money you have saved up towards the down payment. The remainder of the money is the amount that you would borrow. Depending on the type of loan you choose, your monthly payments and how long you will make those payments will vary. There is a simple formula that you can use to estimate your monthly payment: \n",

Notice that we chose not to input the sales tax rate and instead just assigned it to the variable `SalesTaxRate`. If you wanted, you could also have that be entered as input. What you choose to have as input to your program is your design decision. Sometimes the problem may be framed so it explicitly specifies the inputs; sometimes you have to figure that out. In general, whatever you need to make your program more versatile is what you have to base your decisions on. For instance, fixing the sales tax rate to $6.0$ will make the program usable only in places where that rate applies. If, for example, you wanted your friend in another part of the country to use the program, you should choose to make that also an input value. Let us go on to the next steps in the program and encode them in Python. These are mainly computations. The first few are simple. Perhaps the most complicated computation to encode is the formula for computing the monthly payment. All of these are shown in the version below. "

This is a very powerful idea that is couched in terms of very simple ideas. Given a problem, if you can describe its solution in terms of a combination of the three execution models then you can get any computer to solve that problem.

Behavior-based control is a powerful and effective way of describing sophisticated robot control programs. This is the paradigm used in many commercial robot applications. You should try out some of the exercises suggested below to get comfortable with this control technique. The other two programs illustrate how, using the concepts you have learned, you can design other useful computer applications. In the next several chapters, we will explore several other dimensions of computing: media computation, writing games, etc."

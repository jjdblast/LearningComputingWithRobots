      "Designing robot behaviors is a challenging, yet fun process. There isn't a formal methodology or a technique that one can follow. It involves creativity, the ability to recognize the strengths and limitations of the physical robot, the kind of environment the robot will be carrying out the behavior, and of course the knowledge of available paradigms for programming robot behaviors. Creativity is essential to the design of robot behaviors. You have already seen how even a simple robot like the Scribbler can be programmed to carry out a diverse range of behaviors. We have also spent a considerable effort so far in exploring the range of possible functions a robot can perform. Where a robot is placed when it is running can play an important role in exhibiting a programmed behavior successfully. In this chapter, we take a different look at robot behaviors.\n"

      "In 1984, Valentino Braitenberg wrote a book titled: *Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology* (MIT Press). In it, he describes several thought experiments that are centered around the creation of simple vehicles with very simple control mechanisms that exhibit seemingly complex behavior. The purpose of the thought experiments was to illustrate some fundamental insights into the internal structure of animal (and human) brains. Each experiment involves a description of a simple vehicle that is endowed with a small suite of sensors (much like our Scribbler robot) and how the sensors can be connected to the motors of these imaginary vehicles in ways that parallel neurological connections in animals. He shows how the resulting vehicles are capable of complex behaviors which can be described as: fear, aggression, love, logic, free will, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "One central theme underlying Braitenberg's experiments is the demonstration of what he calls the *Law of uphill analysis and downhill invention*: It is much more difficult to guess the internal structure of an entity just by observing its behavior than it is to actually create the structure that leads to the behavior. That is, trying to postulate the internal structure purely by observing certain behavior is an uphill (harder) task whereas trying to create an entity that exhibits a certain behavior is a downhill (easy) task. While all of Braitenberg's vehicles were imaginary and not really designed to be actually fabricated people have found it a fun and intellectually interesting exercise to create them. Personal robots like Scribblers make perfect platforms to do this and in what follows we will describe some of Braitenberg's (and Braitenberg-type) vehicles and design robot behaviors based on them."

In this example, we are only concerned with movements that range from a complete stop to full speed forward, so the values range from $0.0$ to $1.0$.

The most obvious of course is an inverse relationship: the darker it is the closer to 1.0 and vice versa.

      "Notice that, in the program above, we have decided to set values for light threshold (`thresh`) as well as movements to specific values. Also, in all cases, we are using the `move` command to specify robot movement. This is because the `mov`e command allows us to blend translation and rotation movement. Additionally, notice that regardless of the sensor values, the robot is always moving forward some amount even while turning. This is essential since the robot has to follow the light and not just orient towards it. In the case where there is no bright light present, the robot is still moving forward (at half the cruise speed). \n",

Additionally, we have flipped the values of the IR sensors so that the conditions in the if-statements look more natural. Recall that the IR sensors report a $1$ value in the absence of any obstacle and a $0$ in the presence of one. By flipping them (using `1 - value`) the value is $1$ for an obstacle present and $0$ otherwise. These values make it more natural to write the conditions in the program above. Remember in Python, a $0$ is equivalent to `False` and a $1$ is equivalent to `True`. Read the program above carefully and make sure you understand these subtleties. Other than that, the program structure is very similar to the light follower program. \n",

      "Braitenberg uses very simple ideas to enable people to think about the way animal and human brains and bodies are wired. For example, in humans, the optic nerves (as do some others) have crossed connections inside the brain. That is, the nerves from the left eye are connected to the right side of the brain and vice versa. Actually they cross over and some information from either side is also represented on the same side (that is there are straight as well as crossed connections). However, it is still a puzzle among scientists as to why this is the case and what, if any, are the advantages or disadvantages of this scheme. Similarly, observing the behaviors of Vehicles 2a and 2b one can easily see in them parallels in the behavior of several animals, like flies orienting towards light/heat sources. Simple robot behaviors can provide deep insights into complex behavior: that the observation and analysis of something is an uphill task if one doesn't know the internal structure. And, by constructing simple internal structures one can arrive at seemingly complex behaviors. These seemingly complex behaviors have also been shown to influence group behavior in insects (see the picture of article on next page). That is, robots that do not look anything like insects, and not too different in size than the Scribbler, can be used to influence insect behavior in many situations.\n",

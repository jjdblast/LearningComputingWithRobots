      "We mentioned earlier that the notion of computation these days extends far beyond simple numerical calculations. Writing robot control programs is computation, as is making world population projections. Using devices like iPods you are able to enjoy music, videos, and radio and television shows. Manipulating sounds and images is also the realm of computation and in this chapter we will introduce you to these. You have already seen how, using your robot, you can take pictures of various scenes. You can also take similar images from your digital camera. Using basic computational techniques you have learned so far you will see, in this chapter, how you can do computation on shapes and sound. You will learn to create images using computation. The images you create can be used for visualizing data or even for aesthetic purposes to explore your creative side. We will also present some fundamentals of sound and music and show you how you can also do similar forms of computation using music."

      "Most people associate the personal computer (aka the PC) revolution with the 1980\u2019s but the idea of a personal computer has been around almost as long as computers themselves. Today, on most college campuses, there are more personal computers than people. The goal of One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) Project is to \u201cprovide children around the world with new opportunities to explore, experiment, and express themselves\u201d (http://www.laptop.org). Personal robots, similarly, were conceived several decades ago. However, the personal robot \u2018revolution\u2019 is still in its infancy. The picture on the previous page shows the Pleo robots that are designed to emulate behaviors of an infant Camarasaurus. The Pleos are marketed mainly as toys or as mechatronic \u201cpets\u201d. Robots these days are being used in a variety of situations to perform a diverse range of tasks: like mowing a lawn; vacuuming or scrubbing a floor; entertainment; as companions for elders; etc. The range of applications for robots today is limited only by our imagination! As an example, scientists in Japan have developed a baby seal robot (shown on the opposite page) that is being used for therapeutic purposes for nursing home patients.\n",

As you have already seen, your Scribbler is a rover, a robot that moves around. Such robots have become more prevalent in the last few years and represent a new dimension of robot applications. Roaming robots have been used for mail delivery in large offices and as vacuum cleaners in homes. Robots vary in the ways in which they move about: they can roll about like small vehicles (like the lawn mower, Roomba, Scribbler, etc.), or even ambulate on two, three, or more legs (e.g. Pleo). The Scribbler robot moves on three wheels, two of which are powered. In this chapter, we will get to know the Scribbler in some more detail and also learn about how to use its commands to control its behavior. \n"

      "Take a look at the definition of the `yoyo` function above and you will notice the use of parentheses, `()`, both when defining the function as well as when using it. You have also used other functions earlier with parentheses in them and probably can guess their purpose. Commands or functions can specify certain *parameters* (or values) by placing them within parentheses. For example, all of the movement commands, with the exception of `stop` have one or more numbers that you specify to indicate the speed of the movement. The number of seconds you want the robot to wait can be specified as a parameter in the invocation of the `wait` command. Similarly, you could have chosen to specify the speed of the forward and backward movement in the yoyo command, or the amount of time to wait. Below, we show three definitions of the `yoyo` command that make use of parameters:"

That is, stand in one spot, draw a line dividing your two feet, and then turn 90 degrees. If you have no way of measuring, your turns will only be approximate. You can study the behavior of your robot similarly by issuing it turn/spin commands and making them wait a certain amount. Try and estimate the wait time required to turn 90 degrees (you will have to fix the speed) and write a function to turn that amount. Using this function, write a behavior for your robot to transcribe a square on the floor (you can insert a pen to see how the square turns out). "

Make sure you divide the tasks into re-usable moves and as much as possible parameterize the moves so they can be used in customized ways in different steps. Use the building block idea to build more and more complex series of dance moves. Make sure the routine lasts for at least several seconds and it includes at least two repetitions of the entire sequence. You may also make use of the beep command you learned from the last section to incorporate some sounds in your choreography. "

      "Your robot has a small digital camera that can be used to take pictures. A picture taken by a digital camera is represented as an image. As you have seen in the previous chapter images can be drawn and moved about in a graphics window just as if it were any other graphics object (like a line, circle, etc.). We also saw in Chapter 5 how an image taken from the Scribbler\u2019s camera can be viewed on your monitor in a separate window. In this chapter we will learn how to do computing on images. We will learn how images are represented and how we can create them via computation and also process them in many different ways. The representation of images we will use is same as those used by most digital cameras and cell phones and the same representation can be used to display them in a web page. We will also learn how an image taken by the robot\u2019s camera can be used to serve as the camera\u2019s eye into its world using some image understanding techniques. Image understanding is the first step in visual perception. A robot equipped with even the most rudimentary visual perception capabilities can be designed to carry out more interesting behaviors."

      "The picture on the next page shows an example image taken from the Scribbler\u2019s camera. An image is made up of several tiny picture elements or pixels. In a color image, each pixel contains color information which is made up of the amount of red, green, and blue (also called, RGB) values. Each of these values can be in the range $[0..255]$ and hence it takes $3$ bytes or $24$ bits to store the information contained in a single pixel. A pixel that is colored pure red will have the RGB values $(255, 0, 0)$. A grayscale image, on the other hand, only contains the level of gray in a pixel which can be represented in a single byte ($8$ bits) as a number ranging from $0..255$ where $0$ is black and $255$ is white. The entire image is just a $2$-dimensional array of pixels. For example, the images obtained from the Fluke-1 have $256\\times192$ ($W \\times H$) or a total of $49,152$ pixels. Since each pixel requires $3$ bytes of data, this image has a size of $147,456$ bytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "All digital cameras are sold by specifying the number of megapixels. For example, the camera shown below is rated at 6.3 megapixels. This refers to the size of the largest image that it can take. The more pixels in an image the better the image resolution can be when it is printed. With a $6.3$ megapixel image you will be able to create good quality prints as large as $13\\times12$ inches (or even larger). By comparison, a conventional $35$mm photographic film has roughly $4000\\times3000$ or $12$ million pixels. Professional digital cameras easily surpass this resolution and that is why, in the last decade or so, we have seen a rapid decline in film-based photography. For displaying sharp images on a computer you need less than half the resolution offered by the camera shown here. The Fluke-1 camera, with an image size of $147,456$ bytes is only about $0.14$ megapixels. While this is low resolution it is sufficient for doing visual perception for the robot. \n",

      "To make electronic storage and transfer of images (web, e-mail, etc.) fast and convenient the data in an image can be compressed. Several formats are available to electronically store images: JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc. JPEG is the most common format used by digital cameras, including the Scribbler\u2019s. JPEG enables excellent compression coupled with a wider range of colors compared with the GIF format making it useful for most image applications. Myro supports both JPEG and GIF image formats. When we intend to process an image, we will always use the JPEG format. We will primarily use the GIF format for creating animated images.\n"

For example, to transform a $500\\times500$ image you will be operating on $250,000$ pixels. If each pixel transformation involves $10$ operations, you will be specifying $25$ million operations!

The picture was taken by a Scribbler robot. For our purposes we have exaggerated the scene by choosing a bright colored (pink) ball. When you click your mouse anywhere on the image it will give you the RGB values of that pixel. The picture shows the values of a pixel in the center of the ball. Notice that the red pixel is $253$ and the green pixel\u2019s value is $66$. By the way, true pink has RGB values $(255,175,175)$. We can use this information as a way of identifying the ball.
